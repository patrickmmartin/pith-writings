About Me
========

Patrick Martin is software engineer, music fan and lapsed science Ph.D, in roughly that order.

I have worked for SunGard, Deloitte and Touche, Bloomberg, Aquila Group Holdings, among others.

The following would have been a list of languages and technologies, but space and common sense did not permit.  
Instead, let's merely mention that I have done a fair amount of "backend" and "front-end" work in various arenas and the inevitable consequence is chalking up exposure to a number of tools and methodologies.  
Fortunately, I am quite partial to this process.

I also have ambitions to write on technical matters that interest me.
