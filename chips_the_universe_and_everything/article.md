Chips, the Universe and everything (in between)
================================================

... A brief journey
--------------------

### Relativity prescribes there is a total ordering *per reference frame*
### Of interest: re clocks and timing might be the timescale at which certain portions of a system are *not causally connected*
* 1ns === 1 foot
* 33 Pico S === chip size
* ? TODO(PMM) CHECK  Thermalization time for silicon?
 * It's in the fs range ===  microns?
 * Transistors achieve thermal equilibrium on timescales observable over many transistors
 * ... and in fractions of a clock cycle
 * Compare and contrast
 * transit time for 14 nm = 0.0467 fs (femtoseconds)

### Finally, the Einstein clock looks weird because it defies common prejudice
#### But common prejudice is wrong!
#### See the ladder problem
#### ? Ergo we need better diagrams?
 - maybe for program sequence diagrams
 - for ladders passing through barns with rapidly shutting doors at close to the speed of light
   - I dunno it just seems a little niche to me
#### Top down diagram implicitly suggests an observable total ordering
#### TODO(PMM) A better diagram would read the same way in any orientation, allowing people to be guided less by a dominant direction
   TODO(PMM) prior art ?

Two timelines colliding
-----------------------

Close up views of a light cone emitted for an event at a transistor

Example of cones overlap for different timescales.
--------------------------------------------------

* Thermalization of carriers
* current transport
* transistor switching time
* clock transition
* clock cycle
* In core CPU instruction
* main memory fetch
* write to display
* send to Lan
* Send to us

Rewind.

Your GPS fix accuracy
Your mifid2 timestamp
Your milliseconds timestamps
Your first packet of your web page how far can it go?
The screen refresh for your display- how does that compare to the propagation delay?

* Criterion for when the speed of light will impact you
* a nanosecond per foot (so BRITISH)
* when some observable is required somewhere
* - covers the ACK 


### What does it even mean for times defined for parts of the universe that are no causally connected?

### BTW the sci-fi is wrong
You will be able to send white noise to Grandma from Alpha Centauri.
That's all
