The Tao of Scratch
====

Abstract
====

When I look at Scratch, I see something different.

Let me try to persuade you of this by listing and explaining the magic of the  `Good Points`.

# What is Scratch?

_TODO(PMM) something from the web site_

## Inspiration

Seymour Papert

Mindstorms book

## Examples

I am not going to reference any, instead, just go see for yourself in `Good Point 1: it has a single entry search box`.
You can even dive straight in and take a look - in `Good Point 2: Scratch has a "See Inside" button`.
You can then just fork it using `Good Point 3: Scratch has a "Remix" button` - that new project is now available for you to modify, debug and run in any way you see fit.

Although it ruins my since 3-part list rhetorical flourish, let me just mention `Good Point 4 here: Scratch lets you edit before login *and then* allows you to login and preserve your work later if you wish`.
How many _paid for_ services that we use for generating wealth can say the same?

### What can be done in Scratch?

 * Yorkshire to English dictionary
  * https://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=Yorkshire+Dictionary 
 * innumerable RPG type things about cat clans
  * https://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=cat+clans
  * no, me neither
 * Space Invaders
  * aww, yeah...
  * https://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=space+invaders
 * Pacman 
  *  https://scratch.mit.edu/search/google_results/?q=pacman



## Target Audience
I'll be up-front here and state my target audience is the "noble corporate toiler", it has perhaps been a while since you were introduced / subjected to a teaching tool (a memory from work that causes a shudder is the Computer Based Training that was less than tolerant of where irrelevant spaces were or were not in my answers).



## More Good Points

`Good Points 5-14:`

Logo like Sprite Primitives, Code Blocks, Message passing, composable mathematical operations, cloning, entry prompts, text messages, pen operations, sound

These are in my personal order of significance TODO(PMM) cherry pick some to illustrate

TODO(PMM) Sprites with bounce / direction / touching colour VS explicitly positioned/drawn objects



* Immediacy
 
* Accessibility


# Why haven't I mentioned _entirely free to use_ yet?
* If you care about diversity and granting access to self improvement to all then this is huge



# Sharing from `Good Point 3: Scratch has a "Remix" button`
* It exists and works
* Is this because it of `Good Point 15: Scratch has No Merge Action` (for you corporate warriors)


# Deployment - `Good Point 16: Scratch has a "public" checkbox`
* hahahaa - you press "Share"

# Politeness - `Good Point 17: Scratch seems to be incredibly good natured`
* Is it because they're all under 12? ( or perhaps over 30 ?)
 * what element of self selection of the group, and self policing is going on here?
 * is this in fact a _very interesting outcome_?

* Message passing
* `Good Point MMM: there are  "Only a few ways to do certain things"`
 * `Good Point NNN: counterpoint to MMM  'Since when did that stop anyone"`


# TODO(PMM) Is there a dark scratch?

* Scratch has some "Magic" features which are well loved 
 * `Good Point OOO: Vector - bitmap - Vector!`
 * "Other magic" TOOD(PMM)
  * concurrency - what sequence are operations run in?

# Technology
* It's a flask app ( I didn't know )
 * (And I still don't care)
 * And nor do they!


# Can it all be lovely in the garden?
* Security concerns will always be with us
* Is it addictive enough to prevent people progressing?
 * - to HTML (? barf)
 * to python
 * confession time: for the second time (approx 30+ years after the first attempt) I am re-implementing Pacman
  * and I'm finding that talking about the incomplete (broken?) versions I "Saved As" on the way can be instructive
