The Tao of Scratch
====

Abstract
====

When I look at Scratch, I see something different.
Let me try to persuade you.


# What is Scratch?

http://scatch.mit.edu

_TODO(PMM) something from the web site_

## Target Audience
I'll be up-front here and state my target audience is the "noble corporate toiler", it has perhaps been a while since you were introduced / subjected to a teaching tool (a memory from work that causes a shudder is the Computer Based Training that was less than tolerant of where irrelvant spaces were or were not in my answers).

## Basic features

Logo like blocks, Sprite Primitives, Message passing, entry prompts


## Inspiration

Seymour Papert

Mindstorms book

# What can be done in Scratch?
## Example projects
 * Yorkshire to English dictionary
 * RPG type thing about cats
 * Space Invaders
 * Pacman 

* Immediacy
 
* Accessibility


# Why haven't I mentioned _entirely free to use_ yet?
* If you care about diversity and granting access to self improvement to all then this is huge



# Sharing 
* It exists and works
* Is this because it has No Merge Action (for you corporate warriors)


# Deployment
* hahahaa - you press "Share"

# Politeness
* Is it because they're all under 12? ( and over 30 ?)
* Is there a dark scratch?
* Message passing
* "Only a few ways to do things"
 * counterpoint:  'Since when did that stop anyone "

* Magic
 * Vector - bitmap - vector!
 * "Other magic"

# Technology
* It's a flask app ( I didn't know )
 * (And I still don't care)
 * And nor do they!


# Can it all be lovely in the garden?
* Security concerns will always be with us
* Is it addictive enough to prevent people progressing?
 * - to HTML (? barf)
 * to python
 * confession time: for the second time (approx 30+ years after the first attempt) I am re-implementing Pacman
  * and I'm finding that talking about the incomplete (broken?) versions I "Saved As" on the way can be instructive
