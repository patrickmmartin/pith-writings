Good things:

RTTI that *worked*

- cite recent rant on state of affairs in C++
- NO_MACROS
- blindingly fast compilation
- almost perfect dependency management for dependent units (IMHO)
- incremental, smart linker
- simple type system (well until generics, anyway)
 - records (heap, stack)
 - classes (heap *only*)
  - classes had langauge support for inheritance
 - well and also objects, so weird class / record hybrideveryone forgot about
- PROPERTIES
- READ ONLY PROPERTIES
- PROPERTIES
 - indexed properties
- a really good string type right out of the box: "c and c++ - don't think I can't see you in the corner - don't even start, ok?"
- it's just modules all the way down, baby
 - circular dependencies are a _compiler error_, not a "way of life" as some people seem to treat it
 - NO LIBS
 - proper compiler supported initialisation and finalisation
  - NO STATIC INITIALIZATION FIASCO
  - unless you want to write your own
- dynamic packages - again something c/ c++ are still yearning for
- An IDE "that was really good, once"
- well thought through streaming system 
 - feeding into a well through through form design system
-  truly amazing commitment to compatibility (for this day and age) demo apps from VCL version 1(?) _would load and run upon pressing F9 in VCL version 17_
- no RAII :P
- easy FFI interface for "C", COM, c++ with some effort
- language supported reference counted interfaces - so RAII if you want it :)
- IDispatch support (freaky, but whatever floats your boat)
- entire application could be statically linked (with very minimal dependencies) or not, at the "press of a button"
