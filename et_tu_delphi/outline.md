`I come here not to bury Delphi, but to praise it.`

But first what is Delphi?
---------------

>It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma



First, some History
-----

### Table


### The product

There would be regular releases; an incremental generally massively back-compatible update to the VCL and some new classes

### Prior Art

other articles


OK, what made Delphi so Awesome - convince me!
---------------------------

Challenge accepted!

### Salient Features

* Basic usability
* The Language
* The Environment
 
### Inherently more dynamic 


### Source based Component Model

This was the time of the rise of the Component based model - people could pay (remember paying for software?) a nugatory amount for a component that would emulate Excel and embed it into their software.

#### Corrolaries


Code Samples
-----------



### Streaming system - DFM


### Class references



``` pascal
type Foo = type Bar;
```



### language

### NO MACROS 

### built-in types, subrange, set, enumerations


### multitple inheritance


### modules

### "push-button" static linking or dynamic linking with one 


### auto-registry, singletons done right (TM)
#### more compile-time gurantees 
- initialization
  
- finalization


### interfaces are the only multiple inheritance route (i.e. Java, there isn't one)

### NewInstance, CreateInstance if you really want to go that route


### pretty decent set of application classes


### pretty decent set of windowing clases
- handled ownership and parenting and all that good stuff in a manageable manner

### strong component design methodology and support
- interesting, component model from the days of yore, which was part of the then thriving component market 



In retrospect

C'mon it can't have been that perfect, can it?
